    "You can think of a module, such as a specialized dictionary that can store codes, so you can access it with the operator. A class is a way of taking a grouping of functions and data and placing them inside a container so you can access them with it. (point) operator. This is like a \"mini module\" with MyStuff with an apple () function.\n",
    "Objects are like importing.\n",
    "If a class is like a \"mini module\", then there has to be a similar concept to import but for classes. That concept is called \"instantiate\" (create). When an instance of a class is created, what you get is called an object. The first line is the \"instantiate\" operation, and it is very similar to calling a function. Classes are as plans or definitions to create new mini modules. Instance creation allows you to make one of these minimodules and import the same time. \"Instance\" only means creating an object from the class. The resulting created mini module is called an object, and then assigns it to a variable to work with.\n"
